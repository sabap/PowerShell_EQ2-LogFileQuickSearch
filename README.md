# PowerShell_EQ2-LogFileQuickSearch

**Brief synopsis of WHY I wrote this...**</br>
During a raid tonight, there were four items (Symbol of the [Falpping Wing], [Fire Breath], [Slashing Talon] and [Icy Breath]) that were distributed to random players during the loot process.  These items need to be in the posession of a single player, in order to turn in an access quest for a higher level of the instance.  It was asked several times "who has these items?" eventually, everyone checked their bags and the items were located and traded to the proper person.  However, to save time, I thought it would be great to have a tool that I could use to search for randon string of text, like "Symbol of the".  This way, I could see the log entries of the looted items and quickly ask those players fork it up.</br>
Sure, there are tools, like DarqUI Unified that has a log parse feature built in.  I actually tried this first, however found that the this tool will NOT work with a logfile that is currenty opened or in use by the game.  This is where the mighty PowerShell comes in to play...</br>

**What it does:**</br>
This script gathers a list of server directories within your EQ2 Logs directory and gives you a choice of which server you would like to choose the character from which the logs will be parsed.  </br>
After the Server selection, A list of characters are generated by processing the individual logfiles llocated withing that server's log directory. A list of these characters are then presented from which you can choose which to parse.</br>
After the Character selection, the CURRENT LIVE log will be selected and you will be prompted to enter a string of text, for which you wish to search.
Every match will print the entire log line.</br>
After all matches are found and printed to the terminal, the script will ask if you want to search again.  This loop will repeat until you indicate "n", at which point the script will end and close.</br>
